              <p>Hiya~ I&apos;m Ashfire, the owner and founder of BronyTV! I&apos;ve been in this fandom since around the beginning of season 2. Besides my role here at Btv, I&apos;m a relatively quiet observer of much of the fandom. (In other words, besides our nice corner here, I lurk everywhere :P). I play clarinet, and I&apos;m rather good at improv! If you&apos;d like to collab with me, feel free to contact me. I&apos;m rather shy, but I apparently make up for it by being adorable, or so I&apos;m told 6.9</p>
              <p>I&apos;m kind of an otaku, and if you want to talk about currently airing anime, I&apos;m your girl~ you can see what I&apos;m watching at <a href="http://myanimelist.com/animelist/Ashfire">myanimelist.com/animelist/Ashfire</a>. I love getting fan art! you can check out everything drawn for me, paid for or gifted, (it&apos;s a handy reference sheet) at <a href="http://imgur.com/a/lmNxS">imgur.com/a/lmNxS</a>. My image over there was given to me by Danish Toenails~. It&apos;s been a while since I&apos;ve read pony fiction, but I have read a lot. You can check out what I&apos;ve read at <a href="http://derpy.me/AshieFicList">derpy.me/AshieFicList</a>.</p>
              <p>If you&apos;re looking for me, I'm usually on our chat, but if I&apos;m away, you can contact me through Twitter @AshfirePVL. You can also find me on Skype as ashfire2407. If email is more your thing, you can try <a href="http://scr.im/btvashfire">this link</a>, or just ask for my email in chat.</p>

              <p>Hello there, I am the wonderful griffin they call Oatzmeal, but just because I like you, you can call me Oatz. I am the head streamer for BronyTV, so if any of you watch the new episode here, you&apos;re watching it off of my computer. The computer, which I built by the way, has an Intel i5-2500k CPU, an EVGA GeForce 970 SSC Graphics card, 8 GB of RAM, and a SSD with a few terabytes of hard drive storage.</p>
              <p>I started watching MLP either at the end of S1 or between S1 and S2 (don&apos;t remember which) and I first found out about the fandom a few episodes into season 2, and joined BTV back when it was still a synchtube channel about a week after that. Speaking of synchtube, that&apos;s how I got this name! When I first joined the chat on synchtube the first thing that played was &quot;Oatmeal?! Are you crazy?!&quot; so my name for a while was &quot;OatzmealUCrazy&quot; and when we switched over to our own website I just changed it to Oatzmeal.</p>
              <p>If you have any other questions for me or regarding the stream itself, just email me! (The wonderful picture was drawn by our very own BumbleSweet, give her all the praises.)</p>

              <p>I live In The Future&trade; (aka New Zealand) so you&apos;ll usually only see me at weekends, but I try to make up for it by streaming ridiculous amounts of Random Pony, especially during the season (fortunately I don&apos;t have a Life&trade;). I&apos;m a bit quiet and don&apos;t say much (which frequently astonishes me that I ended up hosting Social Night as well), but I try to keep the videos entertaining at least.</p>
              <p>I&apos;ve hung around BronyTV since I became a brony in January 2012, but only became a mod and streamer (somewhat by accident) in December. I&apos;m a software developer by trade and gamer &amp; grammar nazi by avocation, and probably older than everyone else here. :)</p>

I am a person who is generally open minded and I come on here to make friends, which means I tend to not want to fight with others. I am ALWAYS up for new friendships. I&apos;m on most of the time in the afternoons and almost all day on the weekends. So if you need someone, I&apos;ll most likely be there for you~.

              <p>Hiya I&apos;m BumbleSweet ~ I&apos;m a new face around BTV, but I&apos;ve been a fan of the show since mid season one and brony pretty quick after that. Often around whenever I can be, but almost always painting, drawing, or doing something art-ish. That said, I dabble with cosplay and photography as well... Along with that I&apos;m a trading card collector/player (MTG, PTC, and MLP:CCG) ~ I&apos;m currently in school to become a graphic designer. My goal is to work for Pixar, or a local skateboarding magazine. I&apos;d like to think I&apos;m a level headed pony, that will listen to both sides of an argument before putting in my two cents. Along with that, I&apos;m always up to listen and offer advice when needed. So don&apos;t be afraid to shoot me a message~</p>
              <p>Also... Bumble Sweet is admin of pants. Tis fact.</p>

              <p>I tend to be fairly friendly... Except for on my bad days, which I&apos;m sorry for in advance, and... Oh yeah, I&apos;m usually mean to Aris, but we can get along if we REALLY have to. My favorite Ponies are Derpy, Fluttershy, and Luna, and my favorite villains are all of them except for Sombra.</p>
              <p>ANYWAY, my mane project that I help with is Twitch After Dark, which you should definitely check out (during the show season). Other than that, um... yeah... PONIES! :D</p>

Queen Molestia and I have hung around Badlands long enough that I&apos;m sub-mod in there, and I guess being 28 never hurts as well.

              <p>Twitchy is an odd fellow. Quite often he can be found around BTV, trolling random people and just generally having fun. In this sense he is the resident Tara Strong. He is also the resident Trixie Fanatic and one of his life goals is to meet with Sethisto and challenge him to a Trixie Off (No one knows what that means…)</p>
              <p>Twitchy may not be the brightest Pegasus in the world but he seems to get by just fine. Though Twitchy almost always wears a pair of goggles, he has been spotted without them, showing off his blue eyes. He also sports a bandana and a goofy grin most of the time. He also claims to be Half-Demon pony (since his ears curve like horns), but we&apos;re not sure how that works, so we just humor him. He currently serves as host of Twitchy after Dark.</p>
              <p>Twitchy is also somewhat the self-appointed Chief of &quot;Keeping the Mane Chat Spoiler Free&quot;. He even opened up a side chat just for Spoilers, called the &#35;SpoilerCloudBTV.</p>
