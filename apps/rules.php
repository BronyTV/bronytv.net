    <div class="floating"><h3>Rule 1: Keep it PG-16</h3>
      <p>Sexual themes are allowed, but no going into much detail. If you wish to go into further detail, please join our &quot;Adults only&quot; chat room #btvBadlands, which is an 18+ room (16+ if you can show yourself to be mature to the mods there).</p>
      <h3>Rule 2: No racism, sexism or other discrimination</h3>
      <p>None of this will be tolerated in this chat room. Depending on how far you try to go, you could earn yourself a ban.</p>
      <h3>Rule 3: No Spoilers in Mane Chat</h3>
      <p>We try and keep our chat room spoiler-free as much as possible. So if a clip or episode is released/leaked before a Saturday Premiere, we would prefer if you take all spoiler discussion to #SpoilerWagonBTV until <b>after</b> the new ep airs on The HUB.</p>
      <h3>Rule 4: Be nice to the streamer</h3>
      <p>We do not have to be here, nor do we have to do any of this. If the streamer (or any mod for that matter) tells you to stop doing something, then <strong>stop</strong>.  This can earn you a ban if you don&apos;t.</p>
      <h3>Rule 5: Don&apos;t tell someone they are breaking the rules.</h3>
      <p>If you find someone breaking the rules, do not yell at them to stop. First wait for a mod to handle the situation. If it doesn&apos;t look like a mod has noticed, then inform them that someone is breaking the rules. If no mods are on, save the logs (and their join message if you can), post them to pastebin.com, and then use this command to let us know about it:<br />
      <span style="text-align: center;"><code>/msg memoserv send Oatz http://pastebin.com/... or just say who was doing what</code></span></p>

      <h4>CanterNet (our IRC network) also has several rules that you must follow. They include:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>No spamming/Flooding</li>
        <li>No abusive bots, i.e. a bot that attempts to take over channels, mass message users outside of their channel, or attempt to disrupt the network. (In #BronyTV you shouldn&apos;t even have a bot unless an <strong>admin</strong> gives you permission)</li>
        <li>Do not send malware or send malicious links to other users</li>
        <li>You may not use the network to attempt to gain access to another user&apos;s system</li>
        <li>No anti-pony hate spam</li>
        <li>No ban evading. This also applies to channel bans</li>
        <li>No impersonating network staff or members of pony related sites (This means anyone that has +v or higher channel mode, shown in our chat as one of the following prefixes, <strong>+</strong>, <strong>%</strong>, <strong>@</strong>, <strong>&amp;</strong>, and <strong>~</strong>)</li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <p><strong>Failure to follow these rules will result in a network wide ban, not allowing you access to any pony IRC channels on CanterNet such as EverFree Radio, Equestria Daily, Luna Radio, Filly Radio, and many more wonderful channels.</strong></p>
      <p>Thank you for choosing BronyTV for your #1 Brony Stream site!</p>
