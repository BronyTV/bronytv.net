        <h3>Rule 1: Keep it PG rated.</h3>
        <p>Sexual themes are allowed, but no going into much detail. If you wish to go into further detail, please join our &quot;Adults only&quot; chat room #btvBadlands, which is an 18+ room. YOU MUST BE 18 OR OLDER TO JOIN.</p>
        <h3>Rule 2: No racism, sexism, or any other form of discrimination</h3>
        <p>BronyTV follows US Title-VII discrimination policy. This includes <b>any</b> form of discrimination or harassment, at <b>any</b> time. Repeated offenders will be banned, no exceptions. This includes incidences of sexual harassment.</p>
        <h3>Rule 3: No Spoilers in Mane Chat</h3>
        <p>We try and keep our chat room spoiler-free as much as possible. So if a clip or episode is released/leaked before a Saturday Premiere, we would prefer if you take all spoiler discussion to #SpoilerWagonBTV until <b>after</b> the new ep airs on The HUB.</p>
        <h3>Rule 4: Be nice to the streamer</h3>
        <p>We do not have to be here, nor do we have to do any of this. If the streamer (or any mod for that matter) tells you to stop doing something, then <b>stop</b>.  This can earn you a ban if you don&apos;t comply.</p>
        <h3>Rule 5: English Discussion Only in Mane Chat</h3>
        <p>While we do encourage bronies from all over the world to join us, and we do have members of our staff from all over the globe, we don&apos;t want to exclude anyone from conversations. So if you must discuss something with another user in a non-English language, please either use Private Messages or create a separate chat room for your discussion.</p>
        <h3>Rule 6: Don&apos;t tell someone they are breaking the rules.</h3>
        <p>
          If you find someone breaking the rules, do not yell at them to stop. First wait for a mod to handle the situation. If it doesn&apos;t look like a mod has noticed, then inform them that someone is breaking the rules via Private Message. If no mods are on, save the logs (and the hostmask/nick of the user), post them to pastebin.com, and then use this command to let us know about it:<br />
          <span style="text-align: center;">
            <code>
              /msg memoserv send Oatz [put your link or message here]
            </code>
          </span>
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h4>CanterNet (our IRC network) also has several rules that you must follow. They include:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>No spamming/Flooding</li>
          <li>No abusive bots, i.e. a bot that attempts to take over channels, mass message users outside of their channel, or attempt to disrupt the network. (In #BronyTV you shouldn&apos;t even have a bot unless an <strong>admin</strong> gives you permission)</li>
          <li>Do not send malware or send malicious links to other users</li>
          <li>You may not use the network to attempt to gain access to another user&apos;s system</li>
          <li>No anti-pony hate spam</li>
          <li>No ban evading. This also applies to channel bans</li>
          <li>No impersonating network staff or members of pony related sites (This means anyone that has +v or higher channel mode, shown in our chat as one of the following prefixes, <strong>+</strong>, <strong>%</strong>, <strong>@</strong>, <strong>&amp;</strong>, and <strong>~</strong>)</li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Failure to follow these rules will result in a network wide ban, not allowing you access to any pony IRC channels on CanterNet such as EverFree Radio, Equestria Daily, Luna Radio, Filly Radio, and many more wonderful channels.</strong></p>
        <p>Failure to follow any of the rules on this page may result in actions being taken by our moderation team, up to and including a permanent ban from all BronyTV channels. As per Canternet rules, trying to evade this ban can and will result in a network-wide ban.</p>
        <p>Thank you for choosing BronyTV for your #1 Brony Stream site!</p>
