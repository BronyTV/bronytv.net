Hey there, I'm AppleDash. For the record, I hate the ship; I picked this name years ago before I knew what shipping was, and I never bothered to change it because that's what everybody knows me by nowadays. I'm a hobbyist programmer and systems administrator. There's not too much to say about me other than that! If you want to know anything, just ask!
