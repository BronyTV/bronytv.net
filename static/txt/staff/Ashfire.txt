<p>Hiya~ I&apos;m Ashfire, the owner and founder of BronyTV! I&apos;ve been in this fandom since around the beginning of season 2. Besides my role here at Btv, I&apos;m a relatively quiet observer of much of the fandom. (In other words, besides our nice corner here, I lurk everywhere :P). I play clarinet, and I&apos;m rather good at improv! If you&apos;d like to collab with me, feel free to contact me. I&apos;m rather shy, but I apparently make up for it by being adorable, or so I&apos;m told 6.9</p>
<p>I&apos;m kind of an otaku, and if you want to talk about currently airing anime, I&apos;m your girl~ you can see what I&apos;m watching at <a href="http://myanimelist.com/animelist/Ashfire">myanimelist.com/animelist/Ashfire</a>. I love getting fan art! you can check out everything drawn for me, paid for or gifted, (it&apos;s a handy reference sheet) at <a href="http://imgur.com/a/lmNxS">imgur.com/a/lmNxS</a>. My image over there was given to me by Danish Toenails~. It&apos;s been a while since I&apos;ve read pony fiction, but I have read a lot. You can check out what I&apos;ve read at <a href="http://derpy.me/AshieFicList">derpy.me/AshieFicList</a>.</p>
<p>If you&apos;re looking for me, I'm usually on our chat, but if I&apos;m away, you can contact me through Twitter @AshfirePVL. You can also find me on Skype as ashfire2407. If email is more your thing, you can try <a href="http://scr.im/btvashfire">this link</a>, or just ask for my email in chat.</p>
