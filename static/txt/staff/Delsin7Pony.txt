Hey there everypony, I'm Delsin7Pony, but you can call me Delly for short. I'm the resident purveyor of oddities and strange humor. Aside from being a unicorn, I'm a bit of an artist and make custom natural jewellery, a fiddler of GIMP and Irfanview image programs, and creative writer extraordinare. Rarity complex ho! That and I play vidya games... a lot. Also I'm a mod here at BronyTV - not quite sure how that happened. You can find me haunting mane chat and badlands if you need me, but I tend to be online at odd times. Boops for everypony!
