<p>Hi there, I&apos;m Ditznata (or Ditzy for short) and I&apos;m the resident Wet-mane. I also go by the names TheGreatAndPowerfulDitzy and WubsyTheChangeling. Iâ€™m currently in college trying to work my way to a Ph.D in Psychology, so I can become a professional counselor.</p>
<p>I tend to be fairly friendly... Except for on my bad days, which I&apos;m sorry for in advance, and... Oh yeah, I&apos;m usually mean to Aris, but we can get along if we REALLY have to. My favorite Ponies are Derpy, Fluttershy, and Luna, and my favorite villains are all of them except for Sombra.</p>
<p>ANYWAY, my mane project that I help with is Twitch After Dark, which you should definitely check out (during the show season). Other than that, um... yeah... PONIES! :D</p>
