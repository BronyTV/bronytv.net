<p>Hello there, I'm Mercury! You may have seen me around as I've recently become the new director of Ponyville Live! I was a Nuclear Engineer for the U.S. Navy and I happen to know how to manage a server.</p>
<p>I try to be a kind person. If you have any problems I'll do my best to help you out in any way that I can! Please be patient with me, I'm going through a tough time at the moment.</p>
