<p>Hiya~ I'm Ember, the owner and founder of BronyTV! I've been in this fandom since around the beginning of season 2. Besides my role here at Btv, I'm a relatively quiet observer of much of the fandom. (In other words, besides our nice corner here, I lurk everywhere :P). I play clarinet, and I'm rather good at improv! If you'd like to collab with me, feel free to contact me. I'm rather shy, but I apparently make up for it by being adorable, or so I'm told 6.9</p>
<p>I'm kind of an otaku, and if you want to talk about currently airing anime, I'm your girl~ you can see what I'm watching at <a href="http://myanimelist.com/animelist/Ashfire">myanimelist.com/animelist/Ashfire</a>. I love getting fan art! you can check out everything drawn for me, paid for or gifted, (it's a handy reference sheet) at <a href="http://imgur.com/a/lmNxS">imgur.com/a/lmNxS</a>. My image over there was given to me by bumblesweet~. It's been a while since I've read pony fiction, but I have read a lot. You can check out what I've read at <a href="http://derpy.me/AshieFicList">derpy.me/AshieFicList</a>.</p>
<p>If you're looking for me, I'm usually on our chat, but if I'm away, you can contact me through Twitter @EmberMelodica. You can also find me on Skype as ashfire2407. If email is more your thing, you can try <a href="http://scr.im/btvashfire">this link</a>, or just ask for my email in chat.</p>
