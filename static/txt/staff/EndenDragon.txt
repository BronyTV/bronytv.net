An animator, a youtuber, a web developer, and a computer science student. My favorite programming language to play with is Python. During my free time, I create random My Little Pony animations (Check me out!- <a href="http://youtube.com/TheCraftedDragon">TheCraftedDragon</a>), or just chillax with my friends for a chat.
<br>I started watching MLP during the summer of 2014. Fun fact, my first episode is Winter Wrap Up. On BTV, I occasionally stream the process of creating my animations and I am a developer for the website.
<br>If anyone wants to have something done, hit me up! I can be reached on the IRC and <a href="http://twitter.com/EndenDragon">Twitter</a>. Iâ€™m shure I will be there to serve you!
