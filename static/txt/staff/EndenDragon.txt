A programmer, an animator, a youtuber, a web developer, and a computer science student. My favorite programming language to play with is Python. During my free time, I work on a project called <a href="https://TitanEmbeds.com/">Titan Embeds</a> and allow people to put their Discord servers on their sites. I used to create random My Little Pony animations (Check me out!- <a href="http://youtube.com/TheCraftedDragon">TheCraftedDragon</a>). Just chillaxing with my friends for a chat seems fun too~
<br>I started watching MLP during the summer of 2014. Fun fact, my first episode is Winter Wrap Up. While working on my animations, I like to stream the process of creating it, here on BTV. I am one of the developers for this website. However, my main purpose now is to make the stream chat (yep, you've guessed it!, Titan Embeds) to be as awesome as I wanna be!
<br>If anyone wants to have something done, hit me up! I can be reached on BronyTV Discord. Iâ€™m shure I will be there to serve you!
<br>Also, the awesome vector of my OC is done by the great and amazing <a href="http://vapidpixel.deviantart.com/art/EndenDragon-OC-Request-627465461">VapidPixel</a>! :)
