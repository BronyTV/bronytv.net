Greetings, Envirotech (Envy) here! Canadian, Brony, Rush fan, completely bonkers 6_9. I've been hanging around BTV since I first discovered all things pony mid January 2012, became a mod just days before 2013. Queen Molestia and I have hung around Badlands long enough that I'm sub-mod in there, and I guess being 28 never hurts as well. Always around for the mareathon, usually in chat as many nights as possible in between. Oh, and check out my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Envirotech">videos</a>.
