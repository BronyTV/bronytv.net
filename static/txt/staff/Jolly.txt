Well greetings fillys and colts, I'm JollyOldCinema but just call me Jolly or "that british guy who says words and expects people to believe them". To be perfectly honest, I am kinda crazy and that carrys over to my stream where I give behind the scenes looks into upcoming videos in Source Filmmaker along with providing whitty and comedic commentary acompanied by some of the weirdest and best games.
