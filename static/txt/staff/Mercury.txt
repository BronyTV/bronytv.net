<p>Hello there, I'm Mercury! You may have seen me around as I've recently become the new director of Ponyville Live! I was a Nuclear Engineer for the U.S. Navy and I happen to know how to manage a server.</p>
<p>I try to be a kind person. If you have any problems I'll do my best to help you out in any way that I can if you send me a message!</p>
