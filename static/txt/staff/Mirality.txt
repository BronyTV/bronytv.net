<p>I live In The Future&trade; (aka New Zealand) so you&apos;ll usually only see me at weekends, but I try to make up for it by streaming ridiculous amounts of Random Pony, especially during the season (fortunately I don&apos;t have a Life&trade;). I&apos;m a bit quiet and don&apos;t say much (which frequently astonishes me that I ended up hosting Social Night as well), but I try to keep the videos entertaining at least.</p>
<p>I&apos;ve hung around BronyTV since I became a brony in January 2012, but only became a mod and streamer (somewhat by accident) in December. I&apos;m a software developer by trade and gamer &amp; grammar nazi by avocation, and probably older than everyone else here. :)</p>
