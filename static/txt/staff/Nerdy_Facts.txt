<p>Nerdy Facts is the host of the currently unnamed replacement for Twitchy After Dark, which ended in Dec of 2015 upon Twitchy's "retirement".  He also inherited the title of Chief of Spoilers, and runs the &#35;SpoilerCloudBTV chat room.</p>
<p>Nerdy is, well, a nerd. He tends to geek out over many a fandom, including Ponies, RWBY, Nintendo things, Doctor Who and more.  His Cutie Mark is enchanted to change depending on what he's nerding out on at the moment, for example Trixie for ponies or a Tardis for Doctor Who.</p>
<p>He loves talking to fans about any nerdy thing they want.  Oh, and he's a huge gamer and hopes to be able to have a Let's Play on BTV soon.</p>
