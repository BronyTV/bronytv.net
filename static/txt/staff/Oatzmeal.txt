<p>Hello there, I am the wonderful griffin they call Oatzmeal, but just because I like you, you can call me Oatz. I am the head streamer for BronyTV, so if any of you watch the new episode here, you&apos;re watching it off of my computer. The computer, which I built by the way, has an Intel i5-2500k CPU, an EVGA GeForce 970 SSC Graphics card, 8 GB of RAM, and a SSD with a few terabytes of hard drive storage.</p>
<p>I started watching MLP either at the end of S1 or between S1 and S2 (don&apos;t remember which) and I first found out about the fandom a few episodes into season 2, and joined BTV back when it was still a synchtube channel about a week after that. Speaking of synchtube, that&apos;s how I got this name! When I first joined the chat on synchtube the first thing that played was &quot;Oatmeal?! Are you crazy?!&quot; so my name for a while was &quot;OatzmealUCrazy&quot; and when we switched over to our own website I just changed it to Oatzmeal.</p>
<p>If you have any other questions for me or regarding the stream itself, just email me! (The wonderful picture was drawn by our very own BumbleSweet, give her all the praises.)</p>
