<p>Twitchy is an odd fellow. Quite often he can be found around BTV, trolling random people and just generally having fun. In this sense he is the resident Tara Strong. He is also the resident Trixie Fanatic and one of his life goals is to meet with Sethisto and challenge him to a Trixie Off (No one knows what that meansâ€¦)</p>
<p>Twitchy may not be the brightest Pegasus in the world but he seems to get by just fine. Though Twitchy almost always wears a pair of goggles, he has been spotted without them, showing off his blue eyes. He also sports a bandana and a goofy grin most of the time. He also claims to be Half-Demon pony (since his ears curve like horns), but we&apos;re not sure how that works, so we just humor him. He currently serves as host of Twitchy after Dark.</p>
<p>Twitchy is also somewhat the self-appointed Chief of &quot;Keeping the Mane Chat Spoiler Free&quot;. He even opened up a side chat just for Spoilers, called the &#35;SpoilerCloudBTV.</p>
