Hello, I&apos;m catnickfl, most call me cat. I&apos;ve been a brony since late July of 2012. I&apos;m training as an assistant tech by the all powerful ama. (I have a shrine dedicated to him in my closet. All hail the glorious tech god!) I am a person who is generally open minded and I come on here to make friends, which means I tend to not want to fight with others. I am ALWAYS up for new friendships. I&apos;m on most of the time in the afternoons and almost all day on the weekends. So if you need someone, I&apos;ll most likely be there for you~. I hope that I&apos;ll be good friends with you all for the foreseeable future and that as long as bronies exist that we will brony on~.
