Hello, I'm catnickfl, most call me cat. I've been a brony since late July of 2012. I'm training as an assistant tech by the all powerful ama. (I have a shrine dedicated to him in my closet. All hail the glorious tech god!) I am a person who is generally open minded and I come on here to make friends, which means I tend to not want to fight with others. I am ALWAYS up for new friendships. I'm on most of the time in the afternoons and almost all day on the weekends. So if you need someone, I'll most likely be there for you~. I hope that I'll be good friends with you all for the foreseeable future and that as long as bronies exist that we will brony on~.
